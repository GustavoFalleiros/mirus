Mirus is a new operating system with the aim of trying out new and interesting things, in hopes to get the best combination possible. We throw all existing ideas and standards out the window (ie: POSIX, Single UNIX Specification) - and try to see what we can do better.

Mirus is designed primarily for higher-performance machines, such as workstations and gaming rigs, and to be used by those of higher technical knowledge. We also are trying to implement cluster-based computing and advanced load bearing capabilities.

### Core Features
* Powerful executable format
* Dynamic, node based filesystem
* Load bearing and cluster capabilities
* First-party bootloader
* Completely designed for AMD64 architecture
* Forward thinking design
* Resiliant driver framework
* Fast and lean microkernel
* Typical OS stuff (gdt, idt, etc.)

### Testing
To build Mirus, you will need to meet the following dependencies:

* `rake` >= 0.9.6
* `ruby`
* `clang`
* `lld`
* `grub2`
* `yasm`
