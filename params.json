{"name":"Mirus","tagline":"A small operating system written from scratch with the aim of world domination.","body":"Mirus\r\n=====\r\nMirus is a hobby operating system designed to be a playground for new and interesting OS theories.  It is not based on any other exsisting standards, allowing for a great deal of freedom in the development of the concepts behind it.\r\n\r\n## Features ##\r\n* The basics (gdt, irq, isrs, kprintf)\r\n\r\n## Screenshots ##\r\n<img src=\"https://raw.github.com/joshbeitler/mirus/master/docs/resc/screens/mirus_console.png\" width=\"100%\" />\r\n<img src=\"https://raw.github.com/joshbeitler/mirus/master/docs/resc/screens/mirus_colors.png\" width=\"100%\" />\r\n\r\n## Testing ##\r\nMirus will build fine on most Unix systems that have the dependencies installed, and possibly with Mingw/Cygwin (not tested).  Normal development takes place on Fedora 18.\r\n\r\nOnce the dependencies are met, you can clone the repository with the following command:\r\n\r\n`git clone https://github.com/joshbeitler/mirus.git`\r\n\r\nAnd build with `make all`.  To generate a distribution package, perform `make dist`.\r\n\r\nMake will build, link, and generate an ISO image of Mirus using grub2.  This can be run in your favorite VM or on physical hardware.  You can run `make kvm` to run in QEMU.  Note that we currently only officially support QEMU and VirtualBox.\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\n### Kernel\r\nTo build the Mirus kernel, you will need `nasm`, `clang`, and `GNU ld`.  In order to build the ISO image, Mirus uses the `grub2-mkrescue` utility found in the grub2 utilities collection. (Which you probably have if your system uses GRUB2)\r\n\r\n## Resources\r\n\r\n### Inspiration\r\nThese projects helped inspire Mirus's unique kernel architecture.\r\n\r\n* [Plan 9 from Bell Labs](http://plan9.bell-labs.com/plan9/)\r\n* [EROS](http://www.eros-os.org/eros.html)\r\n* [MINIX3](http://www.minix3.org)\r\n\r\n### References\r\nThese documents or sites helped me greatly in the development of Mirus.\r\n\r\n* [OSDev](http://osdev.org)\r\n* [Bran's Kernel Development Series](http://www.osdever.net/bkerndev/Docs/intro.htm)\r\n* [James M's Kernel Tutorials](http://code.google.com/p/jamesm-tutorials/)\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\nOther helpful things to me.\r\n\r\n* [とあるOS](http://torauos.org) - Helped inspire me to work on Mirus.\r\n* [Cosmos](http://cosmos.codeplex.com) - Original stomping ground for my OS dev ventures.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n### Mirus\r\nMirus (and related userspace) is licensed under the MIT License, found below and in the License.md file.\r\n\r\n    The MIT License (MIT)\r\n\r\n    Copyright (c) 2013 Joshua Beitler, Mirus contributors\r\n\r\n    Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\n    of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\n    in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\n    to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\n    copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\n    furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\n    The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\r\n    all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\n    THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\n    IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\n    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
