{"name":"Mirus","tagline":"A small operating system written from scratch with the aim of world domination.","body":"Mirus is a new operating system with the aim of trying out new and interesting things, in hopes to get the best combination possible. We throw all existing ideas and standards out the window (ie: POSIX, Single UNIX Specification) - and try to see what we can do better.\r\n\r\nMirus is designed primarily for higher-performance machines, such as workstations and gaming rigs, and to be used by those of higher technical knowledge. We also are trying to implement cluster-based computing and advanced load bearing capabilities.\r\n\r\n### Core Features\r\n* Powerful executable format\r\n* Dynamic, node based filesystem\r\n* Load bearing and cluster capabilities\r\n* First-party bootloader\r\n* Completely designed for AMD64 architecture\r\n* Forward thinking design\r\n* Resiliant driver framework\r\n* Fast and lean microkernel\r\n* Typical OS stuff (gdt, idt, etc.)\r\n\r\nPlease note that not all of these features are implimented yet.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nWe do not have bleeding-edge ISO images avalible currently.  In order to test drive Mirus, you will need to build it from the source - which is a relatively painless task.  You will want to clone and build the git tree from the `master` branch.  Full build instructions are found in the `support/building.text` file.\r\n\r\nA build of Mirus with no additional configuration or specified tasks will generate a bootable `mirus.iso` in the `build` directory.  You can burn this to any bootable medium you see fit, or run it in a virtual machine via `rake qemu`. \r\n\r\n### Building\r\nYou can run the following commands to configure and build the system:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrake configure\r\nrake\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\nTo build Mirus, you will need to meet the following dependencies.  If you are not sure whether they are installed on your system, `rake` will notify you on build.\r\n\r\n* `rake`\r\n* `ruby`\r\n* `clang` >= 3.3\r\n* `ld`\r\n* `grub2`\r\n* `yasm`\r\n* `xorriso` >= 1.2.9\r\n\r\n### Contributing\r\nIf you'd like to contribute, we would love you to go ahead.  Grab yourself a copy of the source, and get up close and personal with it.  It doesn't bite - trust us!  Make your changes on a seperate fork and send a pull request our way.  See the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file for more details.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracker\r\nIf you run into issues (which we almost garentee you will), please post them on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/joshbeitler/mirus/issues).  Please tag and describe your issue in detail, and if any error codes are provided please include them.\r\n\r\n### Getting Help\r\nWe are active on Twitter at [@mirusproject](http://twitter.com/mirusproject), as well as the IRC channel `#mirus` on `irc.freenode.net`.  The [wiki](https://github.com/joshbeitler/mirus/wiki) is an excellent place to look if you need a quick reference of Mirus.\r\n\r\n### License\r\n```\r\nCopyright 2013 Joshua Beitler\r\n\r\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\nhttp://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\nlimitations under the License.\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
