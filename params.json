{"name":"Mirus","tagline":"A small operating system written from scratch with the aim of world domination.","body":"Mirus is a hobby operating system designed to be a playground for new and interesting OS theories.  It is not based on any other exsisting standards, allowing for a great deal of freedom in the development of the concepts behind it.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n### Note on Source Structure\r\nYou may notice that `readme.markdown` and `license.txt` are symbolic links to accordingly named files in the `support` directory.  In the Mirus world, to keep things clean, files such as READMEs, CONTRIBUTING, Licenses, and related files are moved into a directory called `support`.  You will notice this trend in projects related to Mirus (mirloader, mkdb, mircore, etc.), as well as a lot of applications that run on Mirus.  To not cause any confusion, we have symlinked the README and LICENSE files to the root directory.  Please note that this is not always the case, and also that the symlinks may cause troubles in web-based source viewers that do not support symbolic links.\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\nMirus depends on `clang`, `grub2`, `xorriso`, `ld`, and `nasm` to build the kernel.\r\n\r\n### Building\r\nFirst of all, make sure that you have the most up-to-date source, via `git rebase`.  To  perform a build, simply run `make` on the source root.  The `mirus.iso` file is what you are looking for.  Additional makefile targets can be found in the `support/BUILDING` file.  To learn more about the source and how the directories are formatted, look in `support/source-overview`.\r\n\r\n### Running\r\nYou can burn the ISO image to a disk (CD/DVD) and run it on actual hardware, or in a virtual machine.  We mainly support QEMU and VirtualBox, though most (if not all) capable virtual machines can run it.  We try to keep Mirus compatable with most up-to-date modern hardware.\r\n\r\n### Debugging\r\nMirus has mouthwatering deugging capabilities to make the life of kernel developers easier.  If you build Mirus with the `make debug` target, the kernel image will be compiled with additional debugging symbols and information for `mkdb`, the Mirus kernel debugger.  You can debug Mirus with `mkdb` and `gdb`. In addition Mirus uses serial ports to provide on-the-fly debugging information (two way) when compiled with the `debug` flag.  You can view these logs with `tail -f` or a similar utility.  More information on debugging can be found on the wiki or in the `docs` directory.\r\n\r\n### Kernel Panics\r\nIf you get a kernel panic, please post a new issue on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/joshbeitler/mirus/issues) with the error code, and preferably a stack trace/register dump.\r\n\r\n## Getting Help\r\nSomething broke?  No problem, shit happens.\r\n\r\n### IRC\r\nYou can hook up with us on IRC on `#mirus` on `irc.freenode.net`.\r\n\r\n### Twitter\r\n[@joshbeitler](http://twitter.com/joshbeitler) on Twitter.\r\n\r\n### Reporting Issues\r\nIf you happen upon a bug, want a feature, or need even *more* help, please drop us a line on the Mirus [issue tracker](https://github.com/joshbeitler/mirus/issues).\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n### Mirus\r\nMirus (and related userspace) is licensed under the MIT License, found below and in the License.md file.\r\n\r\n    The MIT License (MIT)\r\n\r\n    Copyright (c) 2013 Joshua Beitler, Mirus contributors\r\n\r\n    Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\n    of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\n    in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\n    to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\n    copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\n    furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\n    The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\r\n    all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\n    THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\n    IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\n    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
