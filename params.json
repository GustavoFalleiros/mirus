{"name":"Mirus","tagline":"A small operating system written from scratch with the aim of world domination.","body":"<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/Ob9C68n.png\" width=\"15%\" />\r\n\r\nMirus is a new operating system with the aim of trying out new and interesting things, in hopes to get the best combination possible. We throw all existing ideas and standards out the window (ie: POSIX, Single UNIX Specification) - and try to see what we can do better.\r\n\r\nMirus is designed primarily for higher-performance machines, such as workstations and gaming rigs, and to be used by those of higher technical knowledge. We also are trying to implement cluster-based computing and advanced load bearing capabilities.\r\n\r\n### Core Features\r\n* Powerful executable format\r\n* Dynamic, node based filesystem\r\n* Homegrown bootloader\r\n* Completely designed for AMD64 architecture\r\n* Forward thinking design\r\n* Resiliant driver framework\r\n* Fast and lean microkernel\r\n* Typical OS stuff (gdt, idt, etc.)\r\n\r\nPlease note that not all of these features are implemented yet.\r\n\r\n### Contributing\r\nIf you'd like to contribute, we would love you to go ahead.
