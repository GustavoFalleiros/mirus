    <h1>Mirus Debugging via Serial</h1>
    Mirus is capable of simple debugging over serial ports.  By default, when running Mirus in QEMU via <code>make kvm</code>, a serial port is opened on a file, <code>/tmp/miruslog</code>.  This build-in debugging facilities can read and write from this file.  You may interface with it via the following preferred ways.

    <ul>
        <li><code>tail -f /tmp/miruslog</code> - tail is a utility with will latch onto the file and monitor it for any updates, and then display them.</li>

        <li><code>echo "message" >> /tmp/miruslog</code> - This will append "message" to the file, which will be read by Mirus via the serial driver.</li>
    </ul>
