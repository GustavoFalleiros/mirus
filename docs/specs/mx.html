# Mirus Executable Format

Mirus uses executables in the `MX` (Mirus Executable) format to help provide security and integration.  Mirus executables support the many platforms that Mirus officially supports.  It is used for the following:

* native programs
* wrapper for first-class VM based languages
* wrapper for first-class interpreted languages
* libraries (class libraries, dynamic libraries)

Executables in the MX format need not have the `.mx` extension, as on Mirus filetype is defined in the file's metadata.  However, most of the time you will find that this naming convention is applied:

* `foo.mx` for programs
* `foo.mx` for interpreted/vm languages
* `foo.lib` for class libraries
* `foo.dlib` for dynamic libraries

## MX Structure
The Mirus Executable format is divided into several sections preceded by a header.  

### Header
The `MX header` describes primary information about the executable, such as the magic number, version, platform, and the locations of the other sections.
