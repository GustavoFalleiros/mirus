command line arguments
======================

Mirus programs use a standardised command line syntax when handling arguments
and such.  This is to help avoid confusion as well as to provide a standard
point from which anyone who knows much about Mirus to be able to work with most
any Mirus application with relative ease.

To facilitate this goal, a command line argument parser has been included into
the Mirus API that provides extreme ease in implimenting arguments and options
that comply to this spec.


argument structure
------------------

All command line arguments are denoted with a dash, regardless of length.

    -a 
    -b 
    -long-option-name 
    -derp

Commands that accept a value follow the Ruby style of using a colon to seperate
the values.
    
    -filename:myfile.txt
    -o:outputfile.txt


base arguments
--------------

These arguments must always be present:

    -help           list all arguments/provide help
    -version        version/program information
