Mirus Documentation
===================
To get the Mirus documentation, you will want to clone the repo, and checkout the branch `docs`
```
git clone https://github.com/joshbeitler/mirus.git mirus
cd mirus
git checkout docs
```
The docs are divided into several directories, each with an `index.html`.  The main directory also has an `index.html`.  All the docs are written in Markdown wrapped in HTML, which is compiled on the fly by [Strapdown](https://github.com/arturadib/strapdown).
